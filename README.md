# Elasticsearch Recommended Products
This project is used to learn more about Elasticsearch. I found a [post](https://spinscale.de/posts/2021-12-08-using-elasticsearch-transforms-for-product-recommendations.html) about using Elasticsearch as an engine to get recommended products for a product(s). Alexander is using tools as transform, ingest and pipelines to convert order items into orders and then use these orders to get recommendations. I will probably not use the same way to develop the same results as I want to develop this via an API. My goal is to in the future build some kind of an API around this system to use this for other systems.

# Plans
- How could I scale this system to be able to use on multiple nodes in a big cluster, am I able to scale this worldwide in some smart way?
